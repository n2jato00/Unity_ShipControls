# Unity Project README

This repository contains the source code for my Unity project.

## About the Project

In this project, users can control a ship. The intention is to further enhance the game by adding a course for the ship to navigate through.

## Scripts

If you're looking for the main script, you can find it at:

- **Folder**: `Assets`
- **Script Name**: `PlayerControls`

Navigate directly to the `Assets` folder and search for the `PlayerControls` script.
